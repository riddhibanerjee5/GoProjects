Bugs: Upon retrieving input from user, the characters "/r/n" were always appended to the input. Debugging included me trying to convert string to int, but then I saw that the result was a 0, notifying me that there was an error. I then displayed the error and found that the characters previously described were being added on to the end of the string. So, I just had to remove these characters.
